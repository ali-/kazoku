# 家族

Kazoku is the Japanese word for immediate family and it reflects the ethos of this project. We offer the ability to create a private network for your circle. The goal is to bring the people that matter to you closer together.


## Features
The core features planned so far:
* Digital photo album
* Message board
* Event calendar


## Technologies
Kazoku is built on Node, Express, React, and Postgres. While there are no immediate plans to change this stack, it is not immutable.


## Status
The project is currently in a pre-release state. Feel free to check-back for updates.


## Contributing
We welcome all contributors of all skill levels.

*Kazoku is free (as-in freedom) software. The software is provided "as is" without any warranty, for you to do whatever you want with.*
